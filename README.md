# census_project_savings

The goal of this exercise is to predict “Which people save more or less than $50,000 / year”) from the information contained in 
the other columns. Profiles are anonymous. The exercise here consists of generating binary classifier using the features of each profile 
such as age, education, wages per hour, etc. This is useful in identifying the features that have greater effect on savings. Information 
obtained can help companies, government, non-profits develop programs to identify and improve upon savings potential.
